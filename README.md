GPA CALCULATOR
------------------------ 

------------------------
DESCRIPTION
------------------------
GPA Calculator is an application that will calculate the user's cumulative GPA throughout the user's college career. The user will be able to enter up to eight courses and its information.

Each course a student attempts will have a certain number of credit hours and a letter grade. The letter grade must be converted to a 4.0 scale in order to be used as part of the calculation.

The GPA conversion chart used for this application can be found here: https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/gpa-scale#:~:text=GPA%20conversion%20chart%20%20%20%20Letter%20Grade,%20%203.3%20%208%20more%20rows%20

The basic formula for calculating cumulative GPA is as follows:

Grade Point Average = Total Points Earned / Total Credits Attempted

Example:
64 Points Earned / 18 Credits Attempted = 3.55 GPA

------------------------
LOG IN
------------------------
The user must create an account and log in in order to use the application. The account data will be lost upon closing the app, therefore an account must be created when re-opening the app.

------------------------
HOME PAGE
------------------------
After logging in, the user is taken to the home page of the app, which contains "Courses" and "Calculator". The user must first go to the "Courses" page and enter data before going to "Calculator". Upon opening the "Calculator" page, the data fields will be disabled, unless data is entered in "Courses".

------------------------
COURSES PAGE
------------------------
The user will enter the course name. Optionally, the user may also enter the days of the week as well as the time of day in which the course takes place.

After the course information is entered, press Enter to save the course.

When the user has finished entering courses, or the maximum of eight courses has been reached, press Done to display the course information and the "Calculator" page.

-----------------------
CALCULATOR PAGE
-----------------------
The data fields will be made available to input once the data is saved in the "Courses" page. The user will choose a letter grade and enter the number of credit hours for each course.

After the user has completed entering data for the courses, press Calculate to display your cumulative GPA.

-----------------------
FINAL NOTES
-----------------------
Knowing how each individual course grade is going to help or hurt you is important when maintaining your GPA. Your grade point average (GPA) is a reflection of your ability, long-term academic performance and how good of student you are.
